# The final project!

I recommend 
1. Reading [the tips on working with github again](https://ledatascifi.github.io/ledatascifi-2021/content/assignments/howto_do.html#working-on-assignments-projects-taking-notes) because these are especially important when working on team repos. 
2. Also, read the page on [team coding](https://ledatascifi.github.io/ledatascifi-2021/content/05/01c_teams.html)
3. Then decide as a team how youâ€™ll work on stuff together. 
4. Read the instructions in total before you get going. They are in a subfolder here and also on the [website](https://ledatascifi.github.io/ledatascifi-2021/content/assignments/project.html). The website version might be easier to read. 
5. Review [Chapter 2](https://ledatascifi.github.io/ledatascifi-2021/content/02/10_Golden_1.html) of the textbook. It is all about tips to make building a project less painful, more productive, and more rewarding.
